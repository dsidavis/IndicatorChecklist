Perhaps arranging the Issues 
 1)  in two tabs - one alphabetically, the other by group.
       The group one could be arranged hierarchically.
      The two sets of checkboxes can be synchronzized as we did for the 

 2)  one list of checkboxes color coded by group.

Having the Calculate Checklist button above the result table of indicators
means that it is not moving around the page as the number of rows in the table changes.

Provide another page listing all of the indicators.

Make it easier to specify the indicators to include or exclude.
  Allow the viewer to click on an id in the result table and include/exclude it.


Package:
If distributing this for others to use is of interest,
 1) create an R package with a function run() to launch the app when the package
    is loaded.
 2) add functions to retrieve updated data from a Web site.




How do we color code the groups?
 
  Can arrange them into groups within the panel in ui.R
